        </p>
        <p>My name is Mario, I'm a Software Developer originally from Graz, but living in Vienna, Austria.</p>
        <p>After finishing my MSc in Software Engineering &amp; Economics at <a href="https://www.tugraz.at/" target="_blank">TU Graz</a> I worked as a Full-Stack Web Developer for five years doing mostly Java and JavaScript with a focus on Clean Code and Software Craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>In September 2016, I decided to quit my job to work as a freelancer and to dedicate some of my time to working in Open Source.</p>
        <p>Currently I work at <a href="https://timeular.com/" target="_blank">timeular</a> and I absolutely love it there. :)</p>
        <p>In the past, I organized the JavaScript User Group and taught at the <a href="https://www.fh-joanneum.at/en/" target="_blank">FH Joanneum</a> in Graz. I frequently visit and speak at meetups as well.</p>
